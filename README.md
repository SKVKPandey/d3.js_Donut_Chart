d3.js_Donut_Chart is a web application made to demonstrate the usage of d3.js in creating animated Data Visualizations. The motivation behind this project
was to learn about d3.js.  

The webpage in the project contains an animated Donut Graph which shows aspects related to Global Finance and Population Distribution throughout the continents of world.


## Technologies Used For Building Graphy
- d3.js
- CSS-3
- JavaScript
- HTML-5
- Bootstrap-5

## Guide For Users

- The folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- User need to run the `index.html` file to view the webpage.
- The following would be visible on the screen:

- There are 3 Options above the Donut Chart (Each shows the relative percentages).
- Population: Shows the Population Distribution of continents across the globe. 
- GDP (Nominal) Share: Shows the GDP (Nominal) contribution per continent.
- Per Captia GDP (Nominal) Share: Shows the per captia GDP (Nominal) of each continent.

## Guide for Developers

- The `index.html` file contains the HTML as well as the Bootstrap Code.
- `style.css` contains the style related to font-format and basic display.
- `app.js` is the file containing the major code required for building the application. All the d3.js and JavaScript programming has been done here.
